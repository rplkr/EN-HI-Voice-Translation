# Voice Translation Project


This repository contains a Python-based voice translation application that allows users to translate spoken language into another language in real-time. The application uses Google’s Speech Recognition API to convert speech to text, Google Translate to translate the text, and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) to convert the translated text back into speech.


## Features


- **Real-time Voice Recognition:** Converts spoken language into text using Google’s Speech Recognition API.
- **Language Translation:** Translates the recognized text into the desired language using Google Translate.
- **Speech Output:** Converts the translated text back into speech using gTTS and plays it using Pygame.
- **Interactive Language Change:** Allows users to change the target language by speaking a command.
- **Stop Command:** Users can stop the application by saying "Stop."


## Installation


To set up and run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rplkr/voice-translation.git
   cd voice-translation
2. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install SpeechRecognition
   pip install pyaudio
   pip install gtts
   pip install pygame
   pip install googletrans==3.1.0a0
3. **Run the Python script:**
   ```bash
   python voice_translation.py
   ```

## Usage


1. **Starting the Application:**
   - Launch the application, which will prompt you to specify the language you want to translate to.
   - Speak your sentences into the microphone for translation.

2. **Language Commands:**
   - **In the Jupyter Notebook:**
     - To switch the target language, say "Another language" and then specify the new language.
     - To terminate the translation session, say "Stop."
   - **In the `app.py` File:**
     - Select the desired language from the dropdown menu to change the translation language.
     - To end the translation session, say "Stop."

3. **Translation and Speech:**
   - The application will transcribe your speech, translate the text into the selected language, and play the translated speech through your speakers. 


## Code Structure


The project consists of the following main components:

- **`voice_translation.py`:** The main Python script that handles voice recognition, translation, and text-to-speech functionality. It includes the following functions:
  - **`record_text()`**: Listens to the user's speech and converts it into text using Google’s Speech Recognition API.
  - **`translator(text)`**: Translates the text to the specified language using Google Translate.
  - **`text_to_speech(text)`**: Converts the translated text into speech using gTTS and plays it using Pygame.
  - **Main Loop**: Continuously listens for user input, processes the translation, and handles commands to change the language or stop the application.


## Dependencies


The project requires the following Python packages:

- `pyaudio`: Used for accessing the microphone and capturing audio input.
- `SpeechRecognition`: Provides the functionality to recognize and convert speech into text.
- `googletrans==3.1.0a0`: Google Translate library for translating text into the desired language.
- `gtts`: Google Text-to-Speech library for converting text to speech.
- `pygame`: Used for playing the audio output generated by gtts.
